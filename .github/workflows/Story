#It was a dark and stormy night when I saw a bright green light shining outside the window.
#I ran outside and the green light got brighter! Soon it was blinding, and I when the light faded enough the see again,
#there was a spaceship landed right in the lawn! 
#The aliens came down from the ship and said to me...

#"You must come with us!" As anyone would, I panicked but there was no use trying to run.
#My body was immobile. I was started to be slowly dragged towards the spaceship, against my will.
#After what felt like an eternity, I was almost directly under the looming ship...
